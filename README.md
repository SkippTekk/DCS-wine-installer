# DCS-wine-installer
A way to play DCS on Linux using pure wine...


Basically this installer will help people install DCS on wine properly to be able to play without using Lutris. No proton will be supported as it's way to difficult to get working.


## Instructions will be posted at a later date.


At the current moment, things will be changing a lot so this will be changing...

Right now the steps are not needed as im recoding my entire thing... Hurray...


# Things that are working.... On my machine

X50 hotas, IR tracking with DelanClip and Opentrack (details for that will be later)
