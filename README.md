# DCS-wine-installer
A way to play DCS on Linux using pure wine...


Basically this installer will help people install DCS on wine properly to be able to play without using Lutris. No proton will be supported as it's way to difficult to get working.


## Instructions will be posted at a later date.


At the current moment, things will be changing a lot so this will be changing...


On file dcs-launch line 3, you need to change the location to where you _are_ installing it. the Root directory. Otherwise it won't properly work and do many funky things cause i don't have sanity checks installed yet.
