# DCS-wine-installer
A way to play DCS on Linux using pure wine...


Basically this installer will help people install DCS on wine properly to be able to play without using Lutris. No proton will be supported as it's way to difficult to get working.


## Instructions will be posted at a later date.


At the current moment, things will be changing a lot so this will be changing...

Steps for hopefully easier for people

1) Download the files and place it in it's OWN folder IE: desktop folder called dcs and unzip the contents into that folder
2) launcher **dcs-helper.sh**
3) Select 2 (to download the proper files)
4) Once the download is completed, Press 1
5) Select the folder location you want it to install, PLEASE have the drive at LEAST 150gb otherwise the installer will freak out at you. I don't have a check for this yet
6) While it's installing, Please OPEN the **dcs-launch** and replace the location for the **WINEPREFIX** where it says REPLACEME
7) Once the install is done, run the **dcs-launch** and it will pop open, IF you have a black screen go back to the **dcs-helper** and select 3 to patch that. (WINEPREFIX must be applied first)
8) If you don't have a black screen, login and enjoy!

If you have any issues, Please open **Issues** tab and give me detailed instructions, "it won't work" or anything that short will be closed and ignored.
